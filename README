rbackup - An rsync-based backup tool
====================================
A tool that automates the use of rsync and extra features for package manager backups.

Features
--------
* Snapshot-based backup management
* Backups of deleted and modified files
* Creation of installed package lists and backup of package manager databases

Advanced Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* rbackup depends on the filesystem that stores the repository to provide features such as checksumming, deduplication, and data integrity verification
* Encryption must be handled by an external program, this is out of scope for rbackup
* xattrs and acl's are handled by rsync but must be a supported feature of the filesystem the repository is stored on

Target Directories
------------------
* /boot/loader
* /etc
* /home
* /root
* /var
  * /var/lib
  * /var/log
* Extras
  * Installed packages
  * Package manager databases

Backup Directory Hierarchy
--------------------------
basedir
├── current
└── data
    ├── snapshot-one
    │   ├── boot
    │   ├── etc
    │   ├── home
    │   ├── pkg
    │   └── root
    └── snapshot-two
        ├── boot
        ├── etc
        ├── home
        ├── pkg
        └── root

* Assuming snapshot2 was the previous backup and snapshot1 was the backup before that:
  * current would link to snapshot2
  * Unchanged files files from snapshot1 backed up to snapshot2 are hardlinked to snapshot1

Implementation Notes
--------------------
* pathlib is used for path handling
  * Only absolute paths are used internally for consistency
* Use --link-dest=
* Use --suffix=, --backup, and --backup-dir=
* When hardlinking, rbackup passes the entire path to avoid needing relative paths

To-do
-----
* Use --suffix=, --backup, and --backup-dir=
* Create config module
* Study how snapshots behave when --delete is passed
* Add __enter__ and __exit__ for PackageManager lockfiles to prevent transactions during backup
* Create snapshot manipulation script
* Interactive cleanup script
  * Repository.__delitem__()
  * Repository.delete_snapshot(name)

Dependencies
