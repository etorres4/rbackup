Contributing
============

Things to remember when submitting pull requests
------------------------------------------------

* Simplicity and reliability are preferred over pure features

  * If a feature can be handled by either rsync or the filesystem, then it is out of scope of the project.

Code Formatting
---------------

* Formatting: black
* Linter: flake8
